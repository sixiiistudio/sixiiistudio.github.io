        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
          After playing countless sessions in high-end studios with high-end prices, our mission was to create a comfortable, creative space, but at rates working musicians could afford. While the space might look modest, musicians who come to Six III Studio will find pro-level gear and an experienced engineer typically found at higher-priced rehearsal studios. This allows artists to easily invest in the time needed to complete their projects and walk away with a top-quality recording.

        “I don't remember how I learned it, but I found you could turn a pair of headphones into a microphone by using them in reverse. If you plugged the headphones into the mic jack on an old stereo cassette deck, you could record yourself. It blew my mind.” (<a href="http://www.noecho.net/interviews/andy-guida-supertouch-altercation-absolution-while-we-wait">No Echo, 11/25/15</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s how it started for Andy Guida back in 1984. Today, the result of his lifelong fascination with recording sound, inspiring musicians and capturing a moment is Six III Studio.
      </p>
      <p>
        Andy has been playing and recording music for 34 years, adding his talents to bands such as Supertouch, Absolution and The Press. In that time, he has played on over a dozen records, many of which were produced, recorded and mixed at Six III Studio under his direction.

        After playing countless sessions in high end studios at high end prices, Andy’s mission was to create a comfortable, creative space at rates working musicians could afford. While there isn’t the wow factor of a big live room, clients who come to Six III Studio will find pro-level gear and an experienced engineer for a price typically found at many rehearsal studios. This allows artists to easily invest in the time needed to complete their projects and walk away with a top-quality recording.
      </p>
      <p>
        The type of music recorded at Six III is as diverse as the musical taste of the owner. Everything from NYHC and punk, to country singer/songwriters, to metal and rock bands has been recorded and mixed at Six III. For Andy, it’s all about his love of good music and the satisfaction he gets helping artists bring the sounds in their heads into the world for everyone to hear.
