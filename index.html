        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
          After playing countless sessions in high-end studios with high-end prices, our mission was to create a comfortable, creative space, but at rates working musicians could afford.
          While the space might look modest, musicians who come to Six III Studio will find pro-level gear and an experienced engineer typically found at higher-priced rehearsal studios.
          This allows artists to easily invest in the time needed to complete their projects and walk away with a top-quality recording.

          “I don't remember how I learned it, but I found you could turn a pair of headphones into a microphone by using them in reverse. If you plugged the headphones into the mic jack on an old stereo cassette deck, you could record yourself. It blew my mind.” (<a href="http://www.noecho.net/interviews/andy-guida-supertouch-altercation-absolution-while-we-wait">No Echo, 11/25/15</a>).

        The type of music recorded at Six III is as diverse as the musical taste of the owner. Everything from NYHC and punk, to country singer/songwriters, to metal and rock bands has been recorded and mixed at Six III. For Andy, it’s all about his love of good music and the satisfaction he gets helping artists bring the sounds in their heads into the world for everyone to hear.
